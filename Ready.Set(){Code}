  <h1>Ready.Set(){Code}</h1>
  <h4>The Greater Flagstaff Chamber launched a city-wide digital initiative called READY.SET(){CODE}. Our mission is to raise awareness among Flagstaff youth to the language of coding and how its relevance transfers across all disciplines. Our free programs include-- FLG Code Camp, FLG Code Clubs, and Hack the Class- Intro to Coding.</h4>
  <p>FLG Code Camp(s) run throughout the summer (each camp lasts one full week). Students learn the basics of coding through an interface that resembles one of a video game thereby building immediate enthusiasm. As the camp progresses, they work in groups to design computer games. The kids also listen to community leaders who are involved in tech related fields.
Hack the Class- Intro to Coding is a program hosted by a school's math or science teacher, operating with a similar but streamlined curriculum to the summer code camp. It runs roughly one hour a day and "takes over" the math or science period. Appropriate for ages 9-17 years old.</p>
  <p>This READY.SET(){CODING} initiative aligns with our Chamberâ€™s overall mission to assist in building a highly-skilled and employable local workforce for tomorrow, advancing a strong business climate, and serving as catalyst for economic development.</p>
  <p>We are providing our Flagstaff youth with science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills; in other words, every possible advantage in meeting the digital demands of our future workplace.</p>
